# SmartWallet [WIP]

This project is a [WIP] and was intended as a replacement for my Turbin3 capstone project after facing issues with Solend and Kamino.

## Overview

Inspired by the recent Bybit hack, where a masked multisig transaction led to the unauthorized movement of $1.4B from a cold wallet, this project aims to introduce an additional layer of security for users managing digital assets.

The goal is to build an **Anchor Program** that functions as a **smart wallet** with configurable **withdrawal limits**. This ensures that even if a malicious actor gains access, they are restricted in the amount they can withdraw, mitigating large-scale exploits
